# votebot
A python script to send out a lot of web requests at once, through a list of proxies. Currently configured and named to vote repeatedly on an online poll.
All of the functions to cast votes, along with header and payload configuration are in votebot.py. wrapper.py is a quick implementation of the votebot functions into a real bot.
